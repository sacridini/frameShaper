# Frame Shaper

In progress...

## Frame Shaper uses Openframeworks (www.openframeworks.cc), an open source C++ toolkit to edit videos in real time. 

## To do:
.Implement the Shape Engine to get the possibility of merging polygons with video.

## Configuration:
The video data is hardcoded. You'll need to edit the "video.load("Chronos.mp4");" line in VideoClass.hpp and add another video to the project folder in "../nitVid/bin/data/". Thats the default project data folder when you use openframeworks.
